# Research-Project-ChatGPT-Prototype

This prototype is made to test the ability of ChatGPT and how it can adapt client code to accomodate 
for breaking changes introduced with major library changes. This will be done using a maven managed
java project library.

# How to run

In the ChatGPT class, add an access token from OpenAI in order to access ChatGPT. Then compile and run the application through maven by using `mvn exec:java`
